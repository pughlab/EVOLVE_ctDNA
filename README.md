# EVOLVE ctDNA: longitudinal analysis of circulating tumour DNA from ovarian cancer patients in a phase II trial of cediranib and olaparib

## Summary

Patients with high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) treated with PARP inhibitors frequently develop resistance, leading to disease progression. Previously, we identified several mechanisms of resistance at time of progression among patients in EVOLVE, including reversion mutations in *BRCA1* or *BRCA2*, amplifications of *CCNE1* and/or upregulation of *ABCB1*. Here, we examined the feasibility of profiling circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) by targeted sequencing to identify mutations in the absence of tumour tissue, and to identify emerging mechanisms of resistance early in the course of treatment.

## Data Availability

Data generated in this study are not publicly available as this is a legacy protocol for which patients did not consent to sharing of primary sequence data. Only minimal data are provided here for the reproduction of key manuscript figures.
